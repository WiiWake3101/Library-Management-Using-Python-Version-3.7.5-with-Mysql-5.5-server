# Library-Management-Using-Python-Version-3.7.5-with-Mysql-5.5-server

Project Title: Library Management System using Python and MySQL

Project Description: As part of my coursework in computer science, I developed a Library Management System using Python and MySQL. The project aimed to automate the day-to-day activities of a library, including book management, member management, and issue and return of books.

The Library Management System was built using Python programming language and MySQL 5.5 for the database management system. The application was designed with a user-friendly interface, making it easy for librarians to manage the library's activities and for users to search for and borrow books.

Throughout the project, I developed my skills in software development, database management, and project management. I also learned how to use agile methodologies to develop software in an iterative and incremental way.

This project was a great learning experience, allowing me to apply the skills I learned in class to a real-world scenario. It also gave me a chance to showcase my ability to work independently and as part of a team to deliver a quality software product.

Overall, the Library Management System using Python and MySQL project was a valuable addition to my portfolio, demonstrating my technical skills and passion for software development.
